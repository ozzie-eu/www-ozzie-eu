# Over 25 years of IT experience.

* I started my career as a systems analyst (a jack-of-all-trades programmer back then) at Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).
* After gaining CRM experience at a Portuguese firm called Novabase, I transitioned to a developer and later database support engineer role at the Portuguese Ministry of Justice.
* I then took on a leadership role as head of unit at a public institution for regulatory affairs.
* I'm currently engaged in a consulting role.

# BIO

**They call me Ozzie.** It's a nickname from school that stuck with close friends - a playful twist on my last name, Os√≥rio. And since "Eu" means "me" in Portuguese, "Ozzie.EU" felt like a perfect fit: a simple statement like "Ozzie, that's me."

**In a Nutshell:**

* IT Developer (with a passion for code!)
* Devoted to loved ones (you know who you are!)
* Tech Enthusiast: Always eager to learn and explore new technologies
* Keen Observer: Keeping a watchful eye on emerging trends
