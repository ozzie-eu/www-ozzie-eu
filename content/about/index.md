# Over 25 years of IT experience.

* I started my career as a systems analyst (a jack-of-all-trades programmer back then) at Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).
* After gaining CRM experience at a Portuguese firm called Novabase, I transitioned to a developer and later database support engineer role at the Portuguese Ministry of Justice IT institute. This is where I spent most of my career.
* I then took on a leadership role as head of unit at a public institution for regulatory affairs.
* Now, I'm happy to be back in my passion: technology consulting and programming.

# BIO

**They call me Ozzie.** It's a nickname from school that stuck with close friends - a playful twist on my last name, Os√≥rio. And since "Eu" means "me" in Portuguese, "Ozzie.EU" felt like a perfect fit: a simple statement like "Ozzie, that's me."

**A Tech Handyman by Experience.** Throughout my career at various companies and institutions, I've encountered a diverse range of support platforms and applications. This exposure, combined with my daily problem-solving skills and a thirst for learning, makes me a jack-of-all-trades in the tech world, just like the Portuguese saying "pau para toda a obra."

**In a Nutshell:**

* IT Developer (with a passion for code!)
* Devoted to loved ones (you know who you are!)
* Tech Enthusiast: Always eager to learn and explore new technologies
* Keen Observer: Keeping a watchful eye on emerging trends
