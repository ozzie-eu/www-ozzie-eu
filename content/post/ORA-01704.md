Having an Oracle database with a given table storing long strings as binary data types (BLOB/CLOB), one might need to perform manual updates on those columns:

```
update myTable set lobColumn='Some String Value' where somekey=somecriteria;
```

The following error might occur while performing the direct update on that column:

```
ORA-01704: string literal too long
Cause: The string literal is longer than 4000 characters.
Action: Use a string literal of at most 4000 characters. Longer values may only be entered using bind variables.
```

The origin of the error is that the string value passed is indeed over 4000 characters long. A simple workaround script that works like a charm is:

```
DECLARE
  vString myTable.lobColumn.%type;
BEGIN
  vString := 'Some very long string value'
  update myTable set lobColumn=vString where somekey=somecriteria;
END;
```

Don’t forget to replace “myTable” and “lobColumn” with your table and column.

HTH.
