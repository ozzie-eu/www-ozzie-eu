In [*The Cross-Platform Mirage*](/post/dotnet-cross-platform-mirage/), we explored how developing on Linux helps uncover the hidden pitfalls of so-called “cross-platform” .NET libraries.
Now, it’s time to go further. The truth is, merely testing on Linux isn't enough anymore — it’s time to **live on Linux full-time**.

## The End of Trust in Windows

For years, developers and users tolerated Microsoft’s quirks in exchange for convenience.
But the latest decisions from Redmond have made that bargain impossible to justify.

The **end of support for Windows 10** leaves millions of perfectly capable machines stranded, coercing users toward upgrading hardware for **Windows 11**—even though most of those systems still perform flawlessly.

Worse yet, Windows 11’s aggressive hardware requirements — from TPM 2.0 to Secure Boot — are less about security and more about enforcing artificial obsolescence.
Microsoft has turned operating systems into subscription pipelines, disconnecting users from control over their own devices.

## AI on Your Desktop… Whether You Want It or Not

Just when you thought telemetry and forced updates were invasive enough, **Microsoft’s push to integrate Copilot AI across the desktop** adds a new layer of unwelcome supervision.
From system-level hooks to continuous “AI assistance” baked into the Start menu and File Explorer, it’s clear this isn’t about productivity — it’s about persistent data collection.

When your operating system monitors what you type, suggestively “helps” you, and ships your context to remote servers, you’ve crossed the line from productivity into surveillance.

## Transitioning to Linux Full-Time

Switching to Linux isn’t a statement of rebellion anymore — it’s a matter of digital self-defense.
Moving your daily life, work, and development to Linux brings not just performance and stability, but **freedom**.
Freedom from licensing traps, forced cloud logins, and the constant fear of what’s being indexed behind the scenes.

Linux distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu, or openSUSE provide everything you need for professional development —
from Docker and VS Code to .NET SDKs and GPU-accelerated AI frameworks.
Gone are the days when Linux meant giving up convenience.

Make the jump. Don’t just test your apps on Linux — **live on it**.

## Owning Your Data Through Open Source

In a world where operating systems are becoming advertising platforms, **open source is the only guarantee of autonomy**.
Every time you replace a proprietary service with an open-source one, you reclaim a piece of your digital independence.

From email servers to self-hosted cloud tools, this shift isn’t just about privacy — it’s about principle.
You own your computer, your code, and your data — or you don’t.

If Microsoft’s AI-fueled direction proves anything, it’s that the era of blind trust is over.
The only sustainable path forward is one of **open systems**, **transparent code**, and **personal control**.

It’s time to stop chasing the mirage — and start living in reality.
