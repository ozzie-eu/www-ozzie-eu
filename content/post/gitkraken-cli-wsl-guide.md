Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) provides a robust environment for developers who need the power and flexibility of Linux without leaving the comfort of their Windows setup. Running WSL allows you to utilize a completely isolated environment where you can natively install and use tools that are designed for Linux. This isolation ensures that your development environment remains consistent and separated from your main operating system, reducing the risk of conflicts and ensuring greater stability.

When it comes to version control, using GitKraken CLI on WSL is especially appealing. While the VS Code Git integration with the Remote - WSL feature is convenient, GitKraken offers enhanced features and integration capabilities. as well as provides an intuitive experience that can significantly improve productivity. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with popular platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, offering advanced features that go beyond the basic functionality provided by the standard Git CLI or the VS Code Git integration.

In this post, I'll guide you through the steps to install GitKraken CLI on WSL and explore how it compares to other Git tools, helping you to leverage the best of both worlds.
