I've added some more examples to the [collection of simple programs](https://github.com/ozzie-eu/automate-dotnetcore), using C#, for automating everyday tasks with .NET Core.
The updated list of examples now includes:
- Organize files inside a folder according to date: date-named-folders
- Compress files inside a given folder into a ZIP archive: compress-folder-zip
- Flatten a folder, moving files to parent directory: flatten-folder
- Scrape html table to csv text file: web-scrape-table
- Take a CSV file and save it into Excel: save-csv-to-excel
- Create a basic Word document: create-simple-docx
- Search text inside Word documents on a given folder and subfolders: search-text-docx
- Get JSON data from a REST end point, parse and display content: read-json.rest-url

The samples are built with [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), the integrated terminal and the following extensions:
- [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
- [Nuget Package Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jmrog.vscode-nuget-package-manager)

This is meant to be my goto library for starting points on multiple recurrent tasks. Also a good personal project to build skills.
