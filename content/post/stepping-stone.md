![Never stop learning](/img/never-stop-learning.jpg)
It's been a while since I've published anything on my previous web log. So, it sort of did not make sense to give it continuity with such a big hiatus. I also wanted to stop using blogging platforms and really have full control on the site's content, navigation and overall source code.

- So for code versioning system and full source disclosure I've chosen [Github](https://github.com/).
- For the web site building and content management framework I've gone with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 
- To publish the site, on my custom domain, with a free SSL certificate, I'm using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

Let's see how it goes.
