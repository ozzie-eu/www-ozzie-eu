				Recently I chose to develop a quick batch solution, for working with SQL Server databases, using Powershell and the Invoke-SqlCmd cmdlet. I was faced with unexpected errors. After quick workaround on the code, I was able to get things done. However, recently I got to redo the batch resulting on a more performant solution. The key to this was the Invoke-DbaQuery Cmdlet.

				As you might have read, I&#39;m a fan of GTD. Having to develop a quick batch solution for some data copying between different SQL Server databases, I chose to use Powershell scripting and the Invoke-SqlCmd cmdlet. However I was faced with unexpected errors for something as trivial as an export/import job.

				Developing a project using .NET Core and Entity Framework, using an existing database, does not come with a Model update wizard. But still, it doesn&#39;t have to be a daunting task.
