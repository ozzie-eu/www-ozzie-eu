      <description>Last year I evaluated the Umbraco Forms product to migrate some existing forms and build new ones. Despite being overall satisfied, I stumbled upon an issue with form control translation. The consent warning translations were not working. Being Umbraco a developer-friendly CMS, the workaround solution was easy enough to come by and extend with this piece of code:
Anyway, the good news is the issue is closed as of today with a report that it&amp;rsquo;s working fine on the upcoming 8.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve published anything on my previous web log. So, it sort of did not make sense to give it continuity with such a big hiatus. I also wanted to stop using blogging platforms and really have full control on the site&amp;rsquo;s content, navigation and overall source code.
So for code versioning system and full source disclosure I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen Github. For the web site building and content management framework I&amp;rsquo;ve gone with Hugo.</description>
